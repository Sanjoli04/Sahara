            <p>We organize Offline Volunteering activities to provide our IITM BS student community with hands-on
                experience into the operations of NGOs. These offline experiences become invaluable, offering
                participants a chance to engage with NGOs, explore partner cities, and contribute meaningfully. Being a
                volunteer in established NGOs not only imparts real-life lessons but also leaves a profound impact,
                inspiring selfless dedication to social causes. It helps us foster connections, create lasting memories,
                and transform online acquaintances into lifelong friends. We strive to make these journeys affordable,
                ensuring inclusivity, and meticulously plan itineraries for seamless exploration. With each successful
                event, our participation exceeds expectations, and we anticipate continued growth in the future.</p>

                <p>
                    In Our 1st Offline Acivity, we collaborated with <strong>Animal Aid Unlimited India (AAU)</strong>,
                    a renowned animal rescue organization located in the <strong>City of Lakes - <em>Udaipur,
                            Rajasthan</em></strong>. With 30+ students joining, we not only volunteered with AAU but
                    also explored Udaipur's iconic sites, balancing city exploration with animal welfare. <br>Guided by
                    AAU representatives, we delved into their operations, interacted with rescued animals, and learned
                    compassionate handling. From Lake Pichola to Bahubali Hills, our journey included famous Lakes like
                    Fatehpur Sagar lake, Landmarks like Gangaur Ghat, Ambrai Ghats & Temples like Jagdish Temple, Karni
                    Mata Temple and a lot more... <br>
                    Witnessing paralyzed and disabled animals find joy was inspiring. Each moment at AAU became an
                    indelible memory, creating bonds and experiences that resonate for a lifetime.

                <p>Our 2nd Offline Activity involved collaborating with the <strong>Robin Hood Army (RHA)</strong>, a
                    multinational youth-run organization dedicated to uplifting underprivileged children in the
                    <strong>Cleanest City of India - <em>Indore, Madhya Pradesh</em></strong>. We gathered donations
                    from our IITM BS community and utilized them to provide stationary items for 30 children. <br>
                    Additionally, we organized a painting competition, a first for these youngsters, distributing
                    chocolates as tokens of appreciation. We also distributed food packets to all those kids brought by
                    RHA members. Our participants espcially females shared valuable insights on important topics like
                    <em>Good touch & Bad touch, menstruation and gave career advices</em>. <br>
                    This impactful experience, coupled with city exploration in Indore, including visits to landmarks
                    like Indore Zoo, Central Museum, and Rajwada Palace, made our Offline Activity & Trip truly
                    memorable.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We brought Big smiles on small faces and won those little hearts atleast for a day.</li>
                    <li>We distributed stationary worth nearly ₹3500 by heartful contributions made by our beloved
                        student community.</li>
                    <li>We explored the Cleanest city of Madhya Pradesh - Indore and made our every moment spent worth
                        cherishing forever.</li>

                            with various historic, religious & cultural significance along with other attractions and
                            also got a chance to volunteer with the Robin Hood academy. The key highlights for me from
                            this trip have to be The Lotus valley, Sahara event- an opportunity to interact and guide
                            the underprivileged kids and Kanch Mandir.

                            And also most important of all, got to meet my peers from across the country, show around my
                            hometown to them and share the bonds of friendship.. I will cherish these wonderful memories
